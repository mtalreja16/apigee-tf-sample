        " - Customer is a Publisher that wants to allow readers to ask questions about the novels in their portfolio in order to determine whether they want to buy them or not\n",
        " - Customer is an author that wants to draw attention to their novels by making them queryable\n",
        " - Customer is an Agent who wants to learn more about the work of the authors they currently represent or are considering representing\n",
        " - Customer wants to provide a service to authors who want to determine if other novels are similar to theirs (finding \"comps\")\n",
        "\n",
        "Steps\n",
        "1) Load and chunk the Book as a PDF from Google Drive\n",
        "\n",
        " - Make chunks large and with a lot of overlap so that model has more context\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Initialize textbison LLM with langchain\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Generate embeddings from the Book\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Store the embeddings in a vector store in Matching Engine\n",
        "\n",
        "5) Use the RetrievalQA chain to send and answer questions about the book by executing the following:\n",
        "\n",
        " - 6) Prompt text-bison LLM “Extract the most relevant search terms from [QUESTION]”\n",
        "\n",
        " - 7) Send those search terms to the vector store and return the top n results as context\n",
        "\n",
        " - 8) Pass that context back to the LLM, giving it a prompt like “please summarize the following results into an answer for [QUESTION]”\n",
